I'm Péter Radics, I've been working in web development since 2020, and I'll be teaching HTML, CSS and Wordpress as a mentor at Programming Career in June 2022. From my original education - social work - I brought with me a client-side approach. In all my work I strive to meet the client's expectations.  Whatever the task, it is always the best to the best of my ability.
